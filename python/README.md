The Event Ticketing System is an interactive application allowing users to view upcoming events, register or log in, and purchase tickets. It supports both regular and premium users, with premium users receiving a 10% discount on ticket prices. The main classes in the system are `User`, `PremiumUser`, `Event`, `Ticket`, and `TicketingSystem`. The `User` class manages standard user attributes, ticket purchasing, and payment storage, while `PremiumUser` extends it to apply discounts on ticket purchases. Events are represented by the `Event` class, which stores event details and ticket availability, while the `Ticket` class creates a unique ticket for each purchase, linking the user and the event. The `TicketingSystem` class manages all user registrations, event listings, and ticket sales. Users can register as either regular or premium members and then log in to view events, purchase tickets, and generate tickets upon successful payment. The system also enables users to log out or exit as needed. Overall, the Event Ticketing System provides a streamlined and interactive way to manage events and ticket sales, catering to both regular and premium users with distinct purchasing benefits.
